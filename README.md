# Three-Trix

A (prototype) Three.js framework.

# Documentation

Documentation will be written later since this is still in early development phase.

# Why make a framework?

Three.js is a good library, but when it comes to organizing code, we are pretty much on our own so far. This framework aims to solve that issue by organizing Three.js code in such a way similar to Unity's architecture.
